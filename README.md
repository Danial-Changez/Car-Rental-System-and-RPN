## Assignment Overview
What is the assignment about?  
Explain the purpose of the program and what it accomplishes.

The assignment involves creating a program that simulates a car rental company using linked lists to manage the cars. The purpose of the program is to efficiently organize cars into categories, such as available for rent, rented, and in repair, while allowing various transactions to update their statuses. It computes rental charges based on mileage and handles file operations for saving and loading data. Additionally, the program implements error handling for improved performance. Overall, this assignment provides experience in manipulating data structures.

## Resources 
Did you use any resources (for example book, notes etc) in this assignment?

I used the slides detailing SLL(singly linked lists), stacks, and merge sort. Outside of class notes,
I consulted online resources to better understand how to implement merge sort, string functions,
error handling, file operations, and the ctype library. I've provided the links below to my sources.
